### 2.1.0 Creating a Network Application

#### *Network Application*

It runs on different hosts and communicate over network.<br>
No need to write software for network core devices, since they do not run user applications.<br>
The development and deployment gone faster due to this property.<br>

### 2.1.1 Application Architecture

What we need to think first before start making network applications.

#### *Client-Server Architecture*

**Servers always on** and wait for clients' requests.<br>
Servers have **permanent IP** address.<br>
To scale up, more **data centers** are needed.<br>

Clients are intermittently connected to servers.<br>
Clients do not directly communicate each other.<br>

#### *Pear-to-Pear Architecture*

No always on server.<br>
Arbitrary hosts directly communicate.<br>
Peer on client side send requests to peer on server side, and server side peer provide service to peer on cliend side.<br>
***Self-Scalability*** means new peers bring new service capacity as well as new service demands.<br>
